Admin section
	- Change multiple users' quota
	- Delete multiple user accounts at a time
	- Disable multiple user accounts at a time
	- Message users
	- Perhaps use ACL for different groups like student, staff, admin. The default quota could then be changed for each group.
	
Backup/restore
	- Set correct content-type in header when viewing files
	- Create directories in uploaded zip files
	- Intelligent metadata processing of more file formats (such as MS Office, image, email archives)
	- Consider displaying files/folders as a tree
	- Prevent duplicate folder names
	- Allow files to be moved up one folder
	- Support different archive types such as tar, tar.gz, tar.bz2. Ideally this should be abstracted so that the same code can 
	  be used to read/write to any archives. Look for libraries for this functionality.
	- Add option for searching in current folder
	- Show the folder the file is in in search results
	- Perhaps add option for extracting uploaded zip files, so that zip files can be uploaded without being extracted
	- Look into zip file number limit
	
User interface
	- Add help section
	- Test on different browsers
	- IE6 specific bugs
	
General
	- Tidy up code, especially backups controller.
	- Consider moving some controller functions to the model
