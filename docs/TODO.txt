Admin section
	- Message users
	- Perhaps use ACL for different groups like student, staff, admin. The default quota could then be changed for each group.
	
Backup/restore
	- Set correct content-type in header when viewing files
	- Intelligent metadata processing of more file formats (such as MS Office, image, email archives)
	- Experiment with displaying files/folders as a tree using ExtJS
	- Support different archive types such as tar, tar.gz, tar.bz2. Ideally this should be abstracted so that the same code can 
	  be used to read/write to any archives. Look for libraries for this functionality.
	- Add option for searching in current folder and in current folder and all subfolders
	- Perhaps add option for extracting uploaded zip files, so that zip files can be uploaded without being extracted
	- Look into zip file number limit
	- Consider changing the file icon function so that it looks for file names with comma separated file extensions, instead of 
	  needing a file for each extension
	- Would be nice to show the amount of files and folders in a folder without opening it
	- Take into account the remaining quota space when displaying the maximum upload 
	- Don't show empty folders select box
	
User accounts
	- Verify email address upon registration?
	
User interface
	- Add help section
	- Test on different browsers
	- IE6 specific bugs
	
General
	- Tidy up code, especially backups controller.
	- Consider moving some controller functions to the model
	- Favicon
	- Cater for possibility of HTTPS when sending URL in password reset email
